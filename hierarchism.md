The current society is founded on dangerous ideas and superstitions, which cause harm to many people living within the system. And the anarchist can clearly see what needs to be done to make repairs. In this sense, when the anarchist talks to people, implants the seed of freedom and attempts to convince everyone to remove their shackles---the anarchist is helping rewrite how people think about traditional culture, how they perceive the world, and what they imagine to be right and wrong.
The anarchist is thus introducing new programming into a system set to self-destruct. The anarchist's social inputs are a kind of fail safe, a reboot disk, or a natural reaction to the ringing of cultural alarm bells of impending disaster. It is, therefore, no surprise that the figure of the anarchist has emerged most heroically in the recent days. Society's reliance on sleeping people with umbilical cord attachments to government has come to a head, and now the anarchistic scream is acting as the natural emergency reaction to a culture that has buried itself beneath its own shit.
Now, the anarchist frantically applies the defibrillator to the heart of a dying society, hoping to resuscitate it. The question is whether people want to be brought back to life.
