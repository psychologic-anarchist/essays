No person who uses evasive phrases like \"I was just doing my job,\" or \"just following orders\" after assaulting or murdering another person can maintain respectability and integrity, regardless of how much their badge shimmers in the light. The conscience of the cop has been darkened, corrupted by social engineering; now these husks of men crawl around in the mud like lower creatures, because they have sacrificed dignity and decency in exchange for barbaric insanity. Indeed, the height of incivility is the destruction of the person to the alter of culturally sanctioned brutality, and the police officer acts as a constant reminder and symbol of how societies destroy the souls of men. In the police officer, we find all the repressions and homicidal impulses of people played out on the stage of life. The badge and costume has bestowed these men with a \"legitimate\" outlet for their psychopathy, and thus in horror we witness the ruination of everything good in the wake of their vindictive purging, of their cathartic bloodletting. Therefore, we must put an end to this blood magic. It is as unacceptable as any other violence. Badges and uniforms and political rituals are not items that negate morality. We must stop providing the cultural artifacts that bankrupt humanness. We must stop intensifying the urge to kill through hallucinated legitimacy.\r\n\r\n### March 6\r\nA lot of people believe that a private security firm or decentralized autonomous defense force would be just as bad as cops. They believe private forces would be out murdering people, shooting dogs, and assaulting people all the same.\r\nBut that is erroneous thinking, which besides denying economic principles, denies a significant psychological factor: the power of belief. Cops currently believe that they have \"authority,\" and that it imbues them with the right to strongarm everyone that crosses their path. Since they sincerely believe they are superior than the average citizen and that they have moral exceptions, they \"know\" they can get away with murder. So long as they cite that they were in danger, or threatened, they can claim innocence for committing murder or canicide.\r\nIt is this psychology of authority that catalyzes their violent activity. If a security force or firm was working the streets to genuinely protect people, this notion of authority would be nonexistent because they would know they do not have moral exceptions over other men, and that politicians and bureaucrats would not be around to support their strongarm tactics. People have to remember that the all-pervasive concept of authority corrupts people's souls by nature and pits them against their fellow man. How long will people stand for their own butchery before they seek to create more positive institutions and abolish this notion that authority is necessary for society to function?\r\n\r\n### March 5\r\nThe current society is founded on dangerous ideas and superstitions, which cause harm to many people living within the system. And the anarchist can clearly see what needs to be done to make repairs. In this sense, when the anarchist talks to people, implants the seed of freedom and attempts to convince everyone to remove their shackles---the anarchist is helping rewrite how people think about traditional culture, how they perceive the world, and what they imagine to be right and wrong.\r\nThe anarchist is thus introducing new programming into a system set to self-destruct. The anarchist's social inputs are a kind of fail safe, a reboot disk, or a natural reaction to the ringing of cultural alarm bells of impending disaster. It is, therefore, no surprise that the figure of the anarchist has emerged most heroically in the recent days. Society's reliance on sleeping people with umbilical cord attachments to government has come to a head, and now the anarchistic scream is acting as the natural emergency reaction to a culture that has buried itself beneath its own shit.\r\nNow, the anarchist frantically applies the defibrillator to the heart of a dying society, hoping to resuscitate it. The question is whether people want to be brought back to life.\r\n\r\n### March 2\r\nIf you see my posts---and you are not an anarchist---and the ideas upset and fluster you, I have accomplished part of my mission. I want you annoyed, frustrated, and on edge. I want to snap you out of your trance, shake you from your cultural coma. I need you hot and bothered, with a bit of cortisol leaking into your blood and brain. I need you to talk about my views behind my back, to hiss and spit, and sometimes curse me. I want you sleepwalking to anarchism, day-walking and speaking in tongues to it. I need my philosophy to infiltrate your soul so that you share it with everyone, so that it pulsates so profoundly in your mind that you cannot rightly ignore it. Yes. I need it to stir you, to inflame you, and to put you on guard. You must be provoked to action. I want your spirit rioting and raging, yearning for truth. Then, I want you reaching out, crying to be released from the torturous and dangerous aura of Statism. And it is in that moment that you may fully awaken, burst from the cocoon of servitude and become what you did not know you could ever become: sovereign---totally free from all fetters.\r\n\r\n### February 29\r\nQuickest way to create a Statist society: teach children that their emotions are wrong, unimportant, and pathological.\r\n\r\n### February 25\r\nSocial justice warriors believe they are fighting against the status quo. This is a tragic and erroneous notion. In reality, they are playing into the divide and conquer games of politicians and overlords. They are engaging in run-of-the-mill political correctness and sampling the social flavor of the day. This is not engaging in iconoclastic behavior, nor upsetting the powers that be in any way. It is actually helping consolidate power of the ruling class, because social justice warrior \"activism\" splits people into various camps, and directly or indirectly gives more legislative control to government criminals. If social justice warriors wanted to actually combat the status quo, they would need to stop focusing on what hurts their feelings and look at who is pointing the guns and killing people. In their egocentric desire to stop people from being mean to them, they have unwittingly aided evil men in accomplishing their murderous and sociopathic aims. Essentially, the ruling classes have taken advantage of their volatile sensitivity and desire to be part of the collective and used it to establish more dominance. Thus, the social justice warriors need to start examining the situation outside of their teary-eyed perspective, and start looking at where real injustice lies. They need to acknowledge the epicenter of evil, and start outright combating government and actual authoritarian elements within society. Merely focusing on who is being mean, saying ugly things, or has sexist, racist, or other monomaniac beliefs is having the opposite effect of their intended goals.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
